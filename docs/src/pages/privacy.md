# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** [Date]

Welcome to CodeAI. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our services.

## Information We Collect

We may collect personal information that you provide to us directly, such as your name and email address when you create an account.

We also collect non-personal information, such as browser type, operating system, and usage details.

### Your Source Code

**We do not store your source code.** When you submit code for analysis via our CLI or web uploader, it is processed in-memory on our secure servers to generate the analysis report. The source code is discarded immediately after the analysis is complete. We only store the resulting analysis report, which does not contain your original source code.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Provide, operate, and maintain our services.
- Improve, personalize, and expand our services.
- Understand and analyze how you use our services.
- Communicate with you, for customer service, and for marketing purposes.
- Process your transactions.
- Find and prevent fraud.

*This is a template. You should consult with a legal professional to draft a complete and compliant Privacy Policy for your business.*
